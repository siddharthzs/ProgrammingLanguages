# TypeScript
It is a language build on top of JavaScript. Everything possible in JavaScript is available in TypeScript.
Advantages:
> Transpiles TypeScript into JavaScript so the advanced ECMAScript features not available to all web browsers can be used by providing a polyfill.
> It acts as a combination of other static checkers combined with Babel.
> It can enforce static typing to catch potential issues earlier in the lifecycle of development. It reduces the need for some unit tests and can analyse the code to find runtime errors at design time.
